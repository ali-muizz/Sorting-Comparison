# Sorting-Comparison

Objective: Measure the average speed of different sorting algorithms given a variety of different list sizes and characteristics.

# Summary of Program Functions

Number arrays are generated, with sizes of 10, 100, 1000, and 10000. For each size of array, there is a list of numbers that is already nearly sorted, a list that is completely randomized, and a list that is the reverse of an already sorted list. Each of these arrays are run through a sorting algorithm 10 times, including bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort, and quick sort. A stopwatch class calculates the run for each time, and an average is found and displayed for every test. This provides useful data on the best algorithms to use for given situations, and analyzes the Big O complexity of different sorting methods.
